Formulatrix Challenge
=======================

1. Write a simple console program that prints the number from 1 to n, for each number x :
print "foo", if x is divisible by 3
print "bar", if x is divisible by 5
print "foobar", if x is divisible by 3 and 5
print the number itself, if x satisfies none of the rule
Here's a sample output of such program with n=15
>> 1, 2, foo, 4, bar, foo, 7, 8, foo, bar, 11, foo, 13, 14, foobar
